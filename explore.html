                <h2 class="animalHeader"> Asian Elephant</h2> 
                <p class="animalInfo"> Today, there are fewer than 52,000 Asian elephants left in the wild. They are also listed as endangered species on the IUCN Red List. The Asian elephant once roamed from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in western Asia as far east as China's Yangtze River. The majority have been eliminated from western Asia completely. From substantial parts of the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, and almost entirely from China.
                <br><br>
                    The greatest threat to wild Asian elephants is habitat loss and fragmentation. Throughout the tropics, humans have cleared large areas of forest and have rapidly populated river valleys and plains. 
                    <br><br>
                    The international ivory trade has contributed far more to the decline of African elephants than Asian ones over the last few decades. Also, many young elephants are removed from the wild to supply tourist and entertainment industries.

                <h2 class="animalHeader"> Giant Panda</h2> 
                <p class="animalInfo"> Native to the mountain forests of southwest China, the giant panda is one of the most beloved animals in the world. With only around 2060 pandas living in the wild, the giant panda is considered vulnerable of extinction by the IUCN Red List. 
                <br><br>
                Due to the fact that pandas reproduce so infrequently, it is very difficult for their population to recover from such a low point.
                One the main reasons that panda populations have declined is habitat destruction. As the human population in China continues to grow, pandas' habitat gets taken over by development, pushing them into smaller and less livable areas. Habitat destruction also leads to food shortages since pandas feed on several varieties of bamboo that bloom at different times of the year.
                To combat this issue, the Chinese government has actively worked to restore and protect bamboo habitat, and these measures have shown positive results.

                <h2 class="animalHeader"> Tiger</h2> 
                <p class="animalInfo"> Tigers are globally listed as “Endangered” on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. The Malayan and Sumatran sub-species are listed as “Critically Endangered.” Wild tigers are hunted to meet the demands of the $20 billion a year illegal wildlife market. Tigers are exploited and abused in the wild and in captivity.
            <br><br>
                    Wild tigers have been brought to the brink of extinction; fewer than 4,000 remain worldwide, and the number may be as low as 3,000. In fact, more tigers live in captivity in the U.S. than exist in the wild globally.
            <br><br>
                    Born Free is working to help make sure that tigers are given the best chance at thriving in the wild. In central India, the Satpuda Landscape Tiger Programme (SLTP) is implementing grassroots community conservation activities to prevent conflict between people and tigers. And, Born Free's sanctuary at Bannerghatta in India provides lifetime care to tigers in need of rescue.</p>
